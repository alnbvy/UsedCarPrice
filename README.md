## General Information
- In this project, I developed several machine learning models to predict the price of used cars.
- The projects contains, feature engineering, data cleaning, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visulization and model development.
- Models include: 1) Linear regression, SVM, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, Neural Network, etc..


## Technologies Used
- Python
- SciKit Learn
- Tensorflow
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Room for improvement:
- Will implement XGboost later

## Acknowledgements
- Thanks to Dr. Robert McCulloch for fruitful discussions.
