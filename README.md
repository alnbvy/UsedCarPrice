## General Information
- In this project, I developed several machine learning models to predict the price of used cars.
- The projects contains, feature engineering, data cleaning, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visulization and model development.
- Models include: 1) Linear regression, SVM, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, Neural Network, etc..
- There are 10 features "trim","isOneOwner","mileage","year","color","displacement","fuel","region","soundSystem","wheelType"
- There is one traget variable "price"
